Trapifier.py
============

This is a script for turning boring, regular sound files into CERTIFIED TRAP BANGERS by overdubbing a variety of samples.  Have you ever wished that boring old Sufjan Stevens track had about 500% more foghorn?  Consider your wish granted.

Example
-------

Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6H8WcTPnWM

Trapified: https://soundcloud.com/japesinator/trapified  <- Temporarily taken down for "plagiarism"

Requirements
------------

This program uses python, so make sure you have that installed.  Pretty much any version should work.  It also uses [pydub](http://pydub.com/) for most of the audio processing.  `pip install pydub` works, and so does cloning the git repository. It also requires [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

I don't think this will work on Windows.  I do not actually have a Windows box to test on at this moment.  If you can confirm whether or not it works, please let me know.  If you can fork the repo and make it work for Windows, that would be really cool.

Installation
------------

Clone the repository and then run trapifier.py.

Usage
-----

Run trapifier.py <inputfile> <outputfile>, where <inputfile> is song to be converted, and <outputfile> is desired title of the created track.  You can also add --samples <directory> to use samples from that directory.

TODO
----

*   Make samples context-sensitive, so they sync up better than random with the music

*   Allow installation via pip

*   Make things work on Windows

Acknowledgements

This program was inspired by [this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1vxdag/guys_i_need_a_favor/).  The samples used are from [this person on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1vhaez/sample_pack_not_sure_if_anyone_is_interested_but/).
